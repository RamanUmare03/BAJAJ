🧩 Tech Stack & Tooling
Python 3.x — Primary development language

C / Cython extensions — Performance-critical routines

pip + requirements.txt — Dependency management

dotenv — Environment variable configuration

Virtual environments — Isolated runtime environments

🚀 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/RamanUmare03/BAJAJ.git
cd BAJAJ
Create and activate a virtual environment:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory and adding your configurations.

Code snippet

DATABASE_URL=...
API_KEY=...
DEBUG=True
Run the application:

Bash

python code.py
🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
The project includes unit tests located under app/tests/.

Recommended framework: pytest

Linting: flake8

Formatting: black

Optional: Type checking with mypy

📐 Architecture & Design Patterns
Modular layering: Ensures clear separation of concerns.

12-factor configuration: Facilitates environment-driven setup.

Performance tuning: Achieved through C / Cython acceleration.

Dependency injection: Improves testability and code organization.

Structured logging: Enhances observability and debugging.

⚙️ Usage Example
Python

from app.module_x import SomeClass

def main():
    obj = SomeClass(config=...)
    result = obj.run_task(data)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
🎯 Roadmap
Extend Cython acceleration across more modules.

Add Docker containerization for simplified deployment.

Integrate CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).

Package the application into a user-friendly CLI tool.

Enhance test coverage to ensure robustness.
